*Fuchsia* reduces differential equations for Feynman master
integrals to an epsilon form.

This is a new version of *Fuchsia*, written in C++ using GiNaC.
This version is still under development, with the main missing
feature being the support for unfactorizable polynomials of powers
higher than two in the denominators. Otherwise this version is
faster and easies to use than the old one.

The previous version can be found at [1].
